# Network structures


# Random graphs

# The Barabasi-Albert model

# Small-world network

The concept of complexity

# Robustness

# Decompositions

# Inferring biological networks

Network represantation, deciphering biological interactions experimentally (e.g PPIs) and inferring networks using statistical methods always contain a lot of underlying assumptions. These assupmtions must be stated and meticulously examined in all levels of the analysis; starting from the experimental design until the network represantion of the system. 

Is the biologist satisfied?

How far is this network from reality, and why?
