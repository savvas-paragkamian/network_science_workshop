## Lecture 3 : Network construction from Models and Data

* models for network creation (random, scale free, small world)
* percolation theory - robustness
* network inference from data
* introduction to dynamic systems on networks

## Lecture 4  : Biological network annotations 

* gene ontology annotation
* bipartite networks
* KEGG pathways annotation
* reactome annotation
* neural networks vs networks
* state of the art in network science

## Presentations {#presentations}

For the final examination of the course all students, individually or in groups of two, will present their assignments. They can choose a specific topic they are intersted in or choose from the list below. Students can present their assignments with slides or using markdown with their code. Duration of presentations will be 20 minutes.

#### Structure

**Chapter 1** 

1. Research question
2. Why it is important?
3. Who did what so far?  Review of literature
4. What remains to be done? Why the biologist is not satisfied?

**Chapter 2**

1. Methodology for addressing the problem
2. Necessary theoretical concepts and results

**Chapter 3**

1. Data (origin, reliability, size)
2. Computations Results 
3. Mathematical meaning of the results 

**Chapter 4**

Biological significance of the results 

**Chapter 5**

Conclusions:

1. Mathematical comparison with available results (what is new)
2. Biological comparison with available results (what is new)
3. General comparison with available results (what is new)
4. Perspectives for future work 


#### Featured topics 

1. Generalize assortativity for every centrality measure and redefine it using information theory
2. Compare network community detection methods
3. Modularity vs Nestedness
4. Centrality lethality rule using Gene Ontology centralities
5. Spreading phenomena
6. Analysis of neural networks as networks
7. Multiplex networks robustness
8. Network analysis of gene ontology as bipartite, as association networks based on terms from real data annotation
