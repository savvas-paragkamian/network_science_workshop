## Lecture 2 : Network construction from Models and Data

* models for network creation (random, scale free, small world)
* percolation theory - robustness
* network inference from data
* introduction to dynamic systems on networks

## Lecture 3  : Biological network annotations 

* gene ontology annotation
* bipartite networks
* KEGG pathways annotation
* reactome annotation
* neural networks vs networks
* state of the art in network science

## Presentations

For the final examination of the course all students, individually or in groups of two, will present their analysis. They can choose a specific topic they are intersted in or choose from the list below.

#### Structure

**Chapter 1** 

Research question
Why it is important?
Who did what so far?  Review of literature.
What remains to be done? Why the biologist is not satisfied?

**Chapter 2**

Methodology for addressing the problem
Necessary theoretical concepts and results

**Chapter 3**

Data (origin, reliability, size)
Computations Results 
Mathematical meaning of the results 

**Chapter 4**

Biological significance of the results 

**Chapter 5**

Conclusions
	1. Mathematical comparison with available results (what is new)
	2. Biological comparison with available results (what is new)
	3. General comparison with available results (what is new)
	4. Perspectives for future work 


#### Featured topics 

1. Generalize assortativity for every centrality measure
2. Compare network community detection methods
3. Modularity vs Nestedness
4. Centrality lethality
5. Spreading phenomena
6. Analysis of neural networks as networks
